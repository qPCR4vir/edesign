2. SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS

 Edesign should compile on any system using an ANSI C compiler like Linux/Unix, MacOSX.
 The Makefile will probably need to be modified for compilation with C compilers other than gcc.


3. INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS - UNIX / LINUX / Mac OSX

 Unzip and untar the distribution. 

 $ tar zxvf edesign-<release>.tar.gz
 $ cd edesign-<release>/src
 $ make

 You will have executables edesign_core_TE, ntdpal_TE, olgotm_TE, 
 long_seq_tm_test_TE and ntdpal_TE in the edesign-<release>/src directory.
 The edesign_core_TE is the main binary file which corresponds to primer3_core 
 in Primer3. The other files correspond to the same binaries in Primer3 without 
 the suffix "_TE". The suffix "_TE" means that the program treats thiazole 
 orange doublly labelled thymine nucleotide (TE).
 To test the main program please run:

 $ edesign-<release>/src/edesign_core_TE -format_output < ../example

 If you need, please copy the executables to a location of your choice. You can 
 optionally set your $PATH to the location. For the edesign_core_TE, the 
 thermodynamic parameters config directory "primer3_config_Z" must be in the same
 directory by default. Otherwise you need to specify the directory by 
 "-config_path <directory path>" option or by "PRIMER_THERMODYNAMIC_PARAMETERS_PATH"
 parameter in your input file.
 In order to run edesign core program

 $ <directory of binary>/edesign_core_TE < yourInputFile
  ----> getting computer-friendly sequential output.

 $ <directory of binary>/edesign_core_TE -format_output < yourInputFile
  ----> getting web-interface format output.

 The command line for Edesign is:
 edesign_core_TE [-format_output] [-p3_settings_file=<file_path>] 
                 [-echo_settings_file] [-config_path=<directory_path>] 
                 [-output=<file_path>] [-error=<file_path>] [input_file]

 If no input file is specified, edesign_core_TE will read its input from stdin.
 The details of command line arguments are:
  -about
       show the release number.
  -format_output
       generate user-oriented (rather than program-oriented) output.
  -p3_settings_file=<file_path>
       specifies a settings file. Edesign reads the global parameters from this
       file first. Tags appearing in the settings file override default Edesign
       settings. The values set in the settings files can also be overridden by
       tags in the input file.
  -config_path=<directory_path>
       specifies the config directory for calculation of hybridization thermodynamics.
       This path overrides the path in the input file. The path should end with "/".
  -echo_settings_file
       print the input tags specified in the given settings file.
       If no settings file is provided or if the -format_output option is given,
       this argument will have no effect.
  -output=<file_path>
       the file where the output should be written. If omitted, stdout is used.
  -error=<file_path>
       the file where the error messages should be written. If omitted, stderr is used.


4. WEB INTERFACE SET UP 

 To install the web interface you may need the perl module CGI.pm (available
 from CPAN, http://cpan.org, if it is not already available in your system).

 Copy all files in the html directory to your .../html or equivalent.
   - default Apache html directory in Linux:
      /var/www/html/edesign/*.htm
   - default Apache html directory in Mac OSX:
      /Library/WebServer/Documents/edesign/*.htm

 Copy all files in the cgi-bin directory to your .../cgi-bin or equivalent.
   - default Apache cgi-bin directory in Linux:
      /var/www/cgi-bin/edesign/*.cgi
   - default Apache cgi-bin directory in Mac OSX:
      /Library/WebServer/CGI-Executables/edesign/*.cgi

 Copy edesign_core_TE built in the src directory to the directory containing
 the cgi-bin files. In addition, copy the subdirectory primer3_config_Z/ to
 the same directory.
 As in the example above:
   - default Apache cgi-bin directory in Linux:
      /var/www/cgi-bin/edesign/edesign_core_TE
      /var/www/cgi-bin/edesign/primer3_config_Z/
   - default Apache cgi-bin directory in Mac OSX:
      /Library/WebServer/CGI-Executables/edesign/edesign_core_TE
      /Library/WebServer/CGI-Executables/edesign/primer3_config_Z/

 (Background: running edesign_core_TE requires the directory primer3_config_Z 
 and its contents. By default this primer3_config_Z needs to be in the current 
 working directory when edesign_core_TE is executed.)

 Depending on the structure of your web site you may have to adjust some of the
 URLs in the .htm .html, or .cgi files.  You might have to fix the #!  headers 
 in the .cgi files to point to your perl.
