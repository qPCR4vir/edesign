# Edesign

Edesign is a design tool for PCR primers together with an internal probe for conducting quantitative PCR and genotypic experiments.

 * Functions for designing internal probes are greatly enhanced.
 * "Genotyping mode" provides design of the internal probe over a user-specified target variant e.g. (SNP, insert/deletion, somatic mutation etc) for genotyping.
 * Modified oligonucleotide can be designed. The original Edesign treats Eprobe and Eprimer.
